1. Basic Device Connection and Info
Check if device is connected:
adb devices
Lists all connected devices.

Get device information:
adb shell getprop
Displays detailed device information like the model, version, etc.

2. Installing and Uninstalling Apps
Install an APK:

bash
Copy code
adb install <path-to-apk>
Installs an APK file on the connected device.

Uninstall an app:

bash
Copy code
adb uninstall <package-name>
Uninstalls an app from the device.

3. Logcat (Log Outputs)
Capture logs:
adb logcat
Displays real-time system logs (logs from apps, system events, etc.).

Save logs to a file:

bash
Copy code
adb logcat -d > log.txt
Saves logs to a file.

4. Shell Commands for Device Interaction
Launch an app's main activity:

bash
Copy code
adb shell am start -n <package-name>/<activity-name>
Launches the main activity of the app.

Simulate a button press (e.g., home button):

bash
Copy code
adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_HOME
Simulates pressing the home button.

Simulate a tap or swipe:

bash
Copy code
adb shell input tap <x> <y>
adb shell input swipe <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>
Simulates touch events like tapping or swiping.

5. Managing App Data
Clear app data:

bash
Copy code
adb shell pm clear <package-name>
Clears app data (useful for testing app behavior from a fresh state).

Force stop an app:

bash
Copy code
adb shell am force-stop <package-name>
Force stops a running app.

6. Screen and UI Interaction
Take a screenshot:

bash
Copy code
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screenshot.png

Record screen:

bash
Copy code
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/demo.mp4
Records the screen on the device.

7. Network Testing

adb shell settings put global airplane_mode_on 0  # Disable
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE --ez state true  # Enable
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE --ez state false  # Disable
8. App Debugging
Start app in debug mode:

bash
Copy code
adb shell am start -n <package-name>/<activity-name> -D
Starts the app in debug mode.

Enable/Disable debugging:

9. Test Automation and ADB Scripting
Run an ADB script or command sequence:
bash
Copy code
adb shell <command-list>
Executes a series of commands on the device through a script.
These commands help QA teams perform various tasks like installing/uninstalling apps, managing app data, automating interactions, debugging, and ensuring devices are functioning properly for testing scenarios.
